kixtart-mode is a major mode for editing KiXtart script files which
implements the following features:

- syntax highlighting
- indentation
- beginning and end of defun
- Imenu support
- Outline mode support

Syntax highlighting is implemented for language keywords, function names,
labels, macros, and variables.  Malformed macro names can potentially drop
trailing syntax or always evaluate to 0, in such cases the relevant portion
of macro names will be highlighted as a warning.

Indentation will be applied by determining the number of script-blocks which
are open around the current buffer position, where parentheses or the
following commands are deemed to open a new or close an existing
script-block:

| Open       | Close          |
|------------+----------------|
| DO         | UNTIL          |
| CASE       | CASE ENDSELECT |
| ELSE       | ENDIF          |
| FOR        | NEXT           |
| FUNCTION   | ENDFUNCTION    |
| IF         | ELSE ENDIF     |
| SELECT     | ENDSELECT      |
| WHILE      | LOOP           |

The indentation offset applied to each subsequent script-block level is
determined by the customizable variable `kixtart-indent-offset' combined with
the indentation level of the line which opened the current script-block.  The
movement function `kixtart-up-script-block' uses the same rules of
script-block definition to move point, to the buffer position which opened
the current script-block, based on its currently determined script-block
level.

`beginning-of-defun-function' and `end-of-defun-function' are implemented and
should work well for function definitions which appear at the "top-level" of
the script.  If FUNCTION commands are not positioned at the beginning of a
line, navigation can be improved by remapping the key which would normally
call `beginning-of-defun' to call `beginning-of-defun-raw' in its place:

(add-hook 'kixtart-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (local-set-key [remap beginning-of-defun]
                           'beginning-of-defun-raw)))

`imenu' will list the names of all defined function as top level menu entries
as well as a single "/Labels" sub-menu entry which lists all defined label
names.

`outline-mode' settings borrow some conventions from the built-in Lisp mode
and will determine outline levels by looking for 3 or more ';' characters
appearing at the start of a line, followed by at least 1 whitespace
character.  ";;;" represents an outline level depth of 1.  Depth is increased
by 1 for every additional ';' character.  FUNCTION commands which appear at
the start of a line will define additional outline levels at the maximum
depth.

Note: Since the KiXtart language does not mandate any structured use of lines
this presents some challenges to line based parsing.  Currently both syntax
highlighting and Imenu entries for function names require the function name
to be declared on the same line as the FUNCTION command.
